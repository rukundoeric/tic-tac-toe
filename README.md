# Tic Tac Toe (Intermediate Ruby)

This is project requires the development of a Tic Tac Toe game in ruby. 

The tic-tac-toe game can be played by two humans on the command line. The tic-tac-toe board is a 3 X 3 grid and players alternate turns until one player is victorious or the game ends in a draw. Players win by securing three consecutive positions on a row, column, or diagonal. The game ends in a tie if neither player has won and all positions on the board are taken.
